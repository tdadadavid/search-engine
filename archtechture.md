## Algorithms we need to search out

* tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency)
* Stemming

## Match Function and Indexer

For the indexer and match function (Query Parser) we have 2 major algorithms we can use

* Stemming (simpler both does not work everytime )
  * if we choose to go with Stemmer then check this out ([Potter Stemmer](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/))
* Lemmanization (harder to implement but enhances both systems) (I think we should go with this.) ([Package](https://nlp.stanford.edu/))
  * [Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/edu.stanford.nlp/stanford-corenlp)
